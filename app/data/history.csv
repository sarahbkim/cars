1980,Navlab,Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab
1984,ALV,ALV projects
1987,Mercedes Benz,"Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project: Ernst Dickmanns and his group at Univ. Bundeswehr Munich (UniBW) build the world's first real robot cars, using saccadic vision, probabilistic approaches such as Kalman filters, and parallel computers. Prometheus Project Spends almost $1 billion for the pan-European Prometheus project, the largest robot car project ever (with UniBW and many others)"
1994,Driving in Paris,"Autonomous vision-based VaMP robot of Dickmanns @ UniBW drives in Paris traffic, tracking up to 12 other cars simultaneously"
1995,CMU,No hands across America (CMU). Throttle and brakes need human control though; UniBW Munich's fast Mercedes robot does 1000 autonomous miles on the highway - in traffic - no GPS!
2005,DARPA,DARPA ""grand challenge"" (limited to US teams): no traffic, dirt roads, driven by GPS: course predefined by 2935 GPS points (up to 4 GPS points per street curve). Obstacle types known in advance"
2006,ELROB,European Land Robot Trials (ELROB): demos of autonomous offroad vehicles
2007,ELROB and DARPA collaboration,New robot car demos and challenges by ELROB and DARPA
2011,Google gets patent,Google awarded an autonomous car petent
2012,"300,000 miles", In May, Google secures Nevada driving licence for self driven car, and announces 300,000 miles and ""there hasn't been a single accident under computer control"" by August"
2016,Autobahn Pilot,"Mercedes plans to introduce ""Autobahn Pilot,"" which allows hands-free highway driving with autonomous overtaking of other vehicles. Mobileeye expects to release hands-free driving technology for its highways"
2017,US Dept of Transportation,"by early 2017 the US Department of Transportation hopes to publish a rule mandating vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication by an as-yet unspecified deadline. GM says that by the 2017 model year, the Cadillac CTS will be V2V equipped"
2018,Mobileye and Nissan,Mobileye expects autonomous capabilities for country roads and city traffic. Nissan anticipates to have a feature that can allow the vehicle manoeuver its way on multi-lane highways.
2020,10 million self-driving cars,ABI Research forecasts that truly self-driving cars would become a reality by 2020 and that 10 million such new cars would be rolling out on to United States' public highways every year by 2032.[94]
2024,Jaguar,Jaguar expects to release an autonomous car.
2025,Daimler and Ford,"Daimler and Ford expect autonomous vehicles on the market.[98][99] Ford predicts it will have the first mass-market autonomous vehicle, but released no target date for this. Most new GM vehicles will have automated driving functions as well as vehicle-to-vehicle communication technology.
2035,95.4 million in sales of the complete self-driving car,IHS Automotive report says will be the year most self-driving vehicles will be operated completely independently from a human occupantâ€™s control. "Navigant Research forecasts that autonomous vehicles will gradually gain traction in the market over the coming two decades and by 2035, sales of autonomous vehicles will reach 95.4 million annually, representing 75% of all light-duty vehicle sales."
2040,75% of cars will be autonomous,Expert members of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) have estimated that up to 75% of all vehicles will be autonomous.
